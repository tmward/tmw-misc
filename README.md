# Intro
This repository holds a collection of miscellaneous programs that I have
written. I tried to impose some semblance of organization into folders.
Description below for each script.

# Videos

## `deidentify_videos.py`
`deidentify_videos.py` takes a directory of video files, strips excess
metadata from the videos, optionally randomizes the name, then places
them in a specified output directory. It requires Python 3.6 or higher,
the Python package [docopt](https://pypi.org/project/docopt/), and the
[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) software package.
